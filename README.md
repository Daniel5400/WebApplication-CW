Description
The Library Management System API is developed and designed to assist the library in managing resources through a RESTful interface. This service permits its users to perform CRUD operations on books, users, publishers, librarians, categories, and borrowings. The API supports user authentication using JWT tokens, role-based access control, and email notifications upon user sign-up.

Features
User authentication and authorization using JWT tokens.
Role-based access control (Admin, User) for different permissions.
CRUD operations for books, users, publishers, librarians, categories, and borrowings.
Email notifications are triggered upon user sign-up.
Integration with Microsoft Azure for deployment.

Prerequisites
.NET Core SDK
Microsoft SQL Server or Azure SQL Database
Postman (optional, for testing endpoints)

Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the solution in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.
Restore NuGet packages and build the solution.
Update the connection string in appsettings.json to point to your SQL Server database.
Run database migrations to create the necessary tables.
Configure any other settings or dependencies as needed.

Configuration
Configure JWT settings (secret key, expiration time) in appsettings.json.
Configure email service settings (SMTP server, credentials) in appsettings.json.
Update other settings (e.g., Azure deployment settings) in appsettings.json.

Usage
Start the application.
Use Postman or any other HTTP client to send requests to the API endpoints.
Authenticate using the login endpoint to obtain a JWT token.
Include the JWT token in the Authorization header for subsequent requests.

Endpoints
POST /API/account/register: User authentication endpoint. Requires username and password in the request body. Returns a JWT token upon successful authentication.
GET /API/books: Retrieve all books.
GET /api/books/{id}: Retrieve a specific book by ID.
POST /api/books: Create a new book.
PUT /API/books/{id}: Update an existing book.
DELETE /API/books/{id}: Delete a book by ID.
...similar endpoints for other entities (users, publishers, librarians, categories, borrowings)

Testing
Use Postman or any other testing tool to send requests to the API endpoints.
Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the API.

Deployment
Deploy the application to Microsoft Azure or any other hosting platform following the deployment process.
